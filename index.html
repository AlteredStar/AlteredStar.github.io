          You have been transported into a fantasy world. You open your eyes in the King's audience chamber. <BR>
          The Kingdom desperately pleas for your help to defeat the Demon Lord. <BR><BR><BR>
          You may wholeheartedly agree to help the poor Kingdom, and your journey to defeat the Evil Demon Lord will begin. <BR><BR>
          You may agree to their request and decide your true alligance later, and regardless of whether or not you fight for yourself, the Kingdom, or against the Kingdom, your journey to defeat the Demon Lord will begin. <BR><BR>
          You may runaway once night falls after gathering information in the Palace, but you will become a wanted criminal in the Kingdom. <BR><BR>
          You may attempt to cajole the Princess in hopes of strengthening your actual influence in the Kingdom; however, success is not guaranteed, and you must stay allied with the Kingdom at least until your efforts have yielded a positive gain. <BR><BR><BR>

          <p> 
          You find yourself in a decorated room deep within the vestiges of an ancient city. The room contains 3 magical cages, each containing an item surrounded by a strong mana aura. <BR>
          While exploring the ruins, you found a magic stone that appears to be a key, but the stone only has enough mana to unlock one cage. <BR>
          Moreover, a message reading "This city shall fade at the behest of a greedy man" is inscribed in old characters on the wall behind the cages. <BR><BR><BR>
          The first cage contains a sleek azure glove, and while standing next to the first cage you can clearly feel the temperature around it fluctuate. <BR><BR>
          The second cage contains a golden goblet, inside you see a deep crimson liquid and the pungent smell of metal assaults your nose. <BR><BR>
          The third cage contains a pure black mantle; when you glance at it, the cloak's image tends to periodically dissipate and rematerialize in front of you. <BR><BR>
          Additionally, you may attempt to open one cage and unlock another by manipulating the mana enshrouding it; however, your escape is not guarenteed. <BR><BR><BR>
          Which cage do you open?

          <p> 
          You become an adventurer to earn money for your hometown, and after 1 week you have completed 3 gathering requests for the local guild. <BR><BR><BR>
          You may take on another gathering request, but the only requests you can take have low yield to effort ratios. <BR><BR>
          You may challenge a solo hunting request to earn more money, but successfully completing a hunting request as a single beginner adventurer is not common and if you cannot complete the request in 3 days the guild will penalize you. <BR><BR>
          You may challenge a hunting request with a party; although you will earn less money as the novice of the group, the chances of surviving and succeeding are much higher than challenging the request alone. <BR><BR>
          You may pick an escort request with a party; while the earnings are less than hunting quests, you will have a reliable method of reaching the Palace City where the rewards are more bountiful. <BR><BR><BR>

          While on an escort request you encounter a group of 7 bandits blocking the road. <BR>
          Your party consists of yourself, one warrior, one archer, and the merchant. <BR><BR><BR>
